# Search Audiences with DSL

Prefer `--query` for ad-hoc people, company, and opportunity (deal) counts and ID searches,
and for activity counts. These queries
search the workspace's existing records, not the net-new prospect database.
For a saved segment, read `filters.md` and encode the criteria in `--filter`.
Do not turn these queries' matching emails, domains, or IDs into the saved
filter unless the user explicitly wants a fixed cohort. `create` and `update`
do not accept `--query`.
Use the default field IDs in `SKILL.md`; for other fields, discover IDs once with
`clay audiences fields list --entity-type people --include-system` (or
`companies`) and reuse the response. A field's existence does not mean it is
populated. See `answering-data-questions.md` for checking coverage and values.

```bash
clay audiences records search-count --query 'count from people where email is_not_null'
clay audiences records search-ids --query 'select from companies where domain = "clay.com"' --limit 100 | jq .data
```

Use `count from <root> where ...` with `search-count` to count the entire match set.
Use `select from people|companies|opportunities where ...` with `search-ids` to return `.data` and an optional `.cursor`.
To count and fetch IDs for the same scope, keep the `from ... where ...` clause and
change `count` to `select`; add `order by` only to the `select` query when ranking.
The commands do not rewrite the query for you.
When paging unsorted IDs, repeat the same `select` query and
pass the cursor verbatim to `--cursor`; stop when it is absent. Use `--limit` for
ID page size, not a DSL limit clause. Sorted queries instead return bounded top-N
IDs without a cursor (see below). Counts cover the whole scope even when
the count query includes a limit. `--archived` searches archived records.
The query's `from` root determines what is counted or returned; omit
`--entity-type`. The flag is required for AST, saved-audience, and unfiltered
searches. Combining `--entity-type` with `--query` is an error, even if they name the same entity.

## Deals and activities

Use `opportunities` (not `deals`) as the DSL root to return deal counts or IDs.
Discover deal fields with `clay audiences fields list --entity-type deals`.
Use `records get --entity-type deals --ids ...` to read the returned deal IDs.

```bash
clay audiences records search-count --query 'count from opportunities where is_closed = false'
clay audiences records search-ids --query 'select from opportunities where is_closed = false' --limit 10
clay audiences records search-count --query 'count from activities'
```

Activity IDs are strings; the current `search-ids` endpoint requires numeric IDs
and cursors, so it cannot page activity IDs. Use the activities commands for a
saved audience's activity feed. Activity counts can use `count from activities`.

For associated records, use predicates such as
`select from opportunities where company.domain = "clay.com"` or
`select from companies where opportunities.exists(is_won = true)`.
The root determines what is returned: the first query returns deals, the second companies.
Activity predicates can use typed fields, for example
`count from activities where task.subject contains "demo"`.

## Sorting and top-N results

**Server-side sorting is the best way to answer "Top N" questions supported by
the DSL** — for example, the biggest deals, companies with the most employees,
or alphabetically first contacts. Use `order by` with `--limit N`, then
fetch details for those IDs only. Do not paginate through the full record set
and sort it locally, and do not sort an arbitrary first page and call it the
workspace's top N. Ranking applies across the full matching scope before the limit.

Use `order by <field> [asc|desc]` in a `search-ids --query` to rank people,
companies, or opportunities by one field on the returned entity. Discover the
field first with `clay audiences fields list --entity-type people|companies|deals`;
use its ID or an unambiguous normalized display name. Supported sort fields are
text, email, URL, number, currency, and date fields with search mappings. Native
`id` and `created_at` columns are also sortable. Ascending is the default.
Missing values come last in both directions, with ascending record ID breaking
ties.

**Check the field type before sorting.** Inspect `dataType` from `fields list`
for the selected entity; do not infer it from the field name or a screenshot of
returned values. For example:

```bash
clay audiences fields list --entity-type deals --include-system --filter 'id=amount' | jq '.data[] | {id, name, dataType}'
```

Number and currency fields sort by numeric value; text, email, and URL fields sort
lexicographically, even when their contents look like numbers. Ascending numbers
`2, 10, 100` and text `"10", "100", "2"` have different orderings. Amount,
revenue, score, and other numeric rankings require `dataType: "number"` or
`dataType: "currency"`; date rankings require a date field. Do not interpret numeric-looking text as a numeric
Top N result.

If a field representing numeric values is typed as text, explain the mismatch
and recommend correcting the **Audiences field type** to number before ranking.
Do not silently sort it as text, invent a DSL cast, or fetch every record to
convert and sort locally. A ranking request alone does not authorize a schema
change. If the field is managed and its type cannot be edited, recommend a
correctly typed replacement or a correction to its source mapping.

After a type correction, wait for conversion to finish and recheck the ranking;
a metadata change alone does not prove the searchable values have converted.
When validating an unfamiliar or recently converted field, inspect a small set
of returned values in the original ID ranking. Different digit lengths, negative
values, or decimals help distinguish numeric from text order; equal-width
positive numbers can look correct under either. If metadata and observed order
disagree, report the uncertainty instead of claiming a verified numeric ranking.

```bash
# After verifying amount is a number or currency field:
# top 10 won deals and the total count.
clay audiences records search-ids --query 'select from opportunities where is_won = true order by amount desc' --limit 10
clay audiences records search-count --query 'count from opportunities where is_won = true'

# Alphabetically first companies with a domain.
clay audiences records search-ids --query 'select from companies where domain is_not_null order by domain asc' --limit 10
```

- `--limit` sets the maximum returned IDs (default 50, max 10,000). An optional
  DSL `limit` after `order by` further caps it: the smaller limit wins. Specify
  `--limit 100` explicitly when requesting the top 100.
- Sorted results preserve ranking in `.data` and **never return a cursor**,
  even when more records match. Do not interpret this as the full match set.
  `--cursor` with `order by` is rejected; sorted pagination is not supported.
- Count the same `from ... where ...` scope with `search-count`, removing
  `order by` and `limit`. Count queries reject ordering and count all matches,
  not just the selected top N.
- Fetch only the returned IDs with `records get` when field values are needed;
  retain the original ID ranking when presenting hydrated records. Do not fetch
  every candidate and sort locally. A small N bounds the returned result, but
  ranking can still scan a large workspace; narrow filters when appropriate.
- Only one same-entity field is sortable. Related-field ordering, aggregate
  expressions such as summing closed-deal amounts per account, and multiple sort
  keys are unsupported. Relationship predicates can still filter the candidates.
  There is no separate sort flag. This syntax is for Audiences, not CPJ search.

## Supported DSL grammar

This is the syntax supported by **Audiences**. In the sketch below, `[ ... ]`
means optional and `|` means alternatives; neither is literal query text.

```text
query       := select from root [where predicate] [order by field [asc | desc]] [limit integer]
             | count from root [where predicate] [limit integer]
root        := people | companies | opportunities | activities
predicate   := term [or term ...]
term        := factor [and factor ...]
factor      := not factor | (predicate) | comparison | relationship_test
comparison  := field scalar_op value
             | field (in | not_in) (value, ...)
             | field (is_null | is_not_null)
scalar_op   := = | != | < | <= | > | >= | contains | starts_with | ends_with
relationship_test := relationship.(any | exists)([row_predicate])
                   | relationship.count([row_predicate]) count_op number
                   | relationship.count([row_predicate]) (in | not_in) (number, ...)
count_op    := = | != | < | <= | > | >=
value       := "string" | number | true | false | date_expression
date_expression := today() [(+ | -) interval positive_integer unit]
unit        := day | week | month | year
```

- **Query shape:** omit `where` to match every record. Use `select from`, not
  `select * from`, and `count from`, not `select count(*)`. Unsorted `search-ids`
  rejects a DSL `limit`; use `--limit` and `--cursor`. Sorted ID queries accept a
  DSL limit but do not support cursors. Native count queries accept a limit
  but count the whole scope.
- **Fields:** use an existing field ID such as `email`, or the intrinsic fields
  `id` and `created_at`. Use `people.email` from companies and `company.domain`
  from people. Field lookup also accepts normalized display names (for example,
  `job_title` for “Job Title”); prefer discovered IDs to avoid ambiguous names.
  Entity prefixes accept `company`, `companies`, `account`, `accounts` and
  `person`, `people`, `contact`, `contacts`; prefer `company` and `people`.
- **Relationships:** use the other entity's prefix before `.any`, `.exists`, or
  `.count`. A `row_predicate` uses comparisons and boolean groups on that related
  record; it cannot contain another relationship call. Empty parentheses apply
  to all associated records. `.count(...)` requires a trailing comparison.
- **Values:** double-quote DSL strings; single quotes may wrap the whole query in
  the shell. Escape a double quote as `\"` and a backslash as `\\` inside a DSL
  string. Numbers are unsigned integer or decimal literals; booleans are unquoted.
  Lists use parentheses, contain at least one value, and have no trailing comma.
  Match values and operators to the field's data type.
- **Dates:** `created_at >= today() - interval 30 day` uses midnight UTC as the
  anchor. Intervals accept positive integers and singular or plural units, such
  as `week` or `weeks`. A quoted date can also be compared against a date field.
- **Logic:** precedence is `not`, then `and`, then `or`; use parentheses to make
  grouping explicit. Negate text predicates with `not (title contains "Sales")`.
  Keywords are case-insensitive. Line comments use `--` and block comments use
  `/* ... */`; `#` is not a DSL comment.
- **Empty values:** use `email is_null` or `email is_not_null`, without a value
  argument. These use Audiences empty/not-empty semantics, so an empty text value
  is not populated. Do not write `email = null` or `email is not null`.
- **Unavailable here:** selected-column lists, SQL joins/subqueries,
  `group by`, `limit ... by`, `is_similar_to`, `clay.*` functions, jobs, and nested
  relationship calls. For unsupported relationship predicates, use an equivalent
  supported AST filter when available. The executor's
  `$name` variables require API bindings; these CLI commands have no binding flag,
  so provide literal values.

## Taxonomy

Taxonomy returns the distinct values of a field with their record counts.
The DSL supports `GROUP BY`, but it is intentionally excluded from the grammar
available to agents above. Agents must never write or execute `GROUP BY` queries
directly. Use grouping only through `list-values`, which constructs the
`count from ... group by ...` query:

```bash
clay audiences fields list-values title --entity-type people
```

Results include up to 50 values by default; use `--limit` explicitly when more
are needed (maximum 24,999). Grouped results are not supported
by `records search-count` or `records search-ids`. For interpreting values and
handling high cardinality, see `answering-data-questions.md`.

## Text matching

`contains` matches a substring, not a word or a semantic category.
`starts_with` and `ends_with` match a prefix and suffix. These text operators
are case-insensitive. In Audiences,
`title contains "CTO"` can match "Director of Sales". Use `title = "CTO"`
or `title in ("CTO", "Chief Technology Officer")` for exact values; use
`title contains "Engineer"` only when that substring is the intended criterion.
For ambiguous categories, follow the value discovery guidance in
`answering-data-questions.md` before choosing a predicate.

## Relationship predicates (a company's people, a person's company)

Use `people.<field>` from companies, or `company.<field>` from people.
These traverse existing Audiences associations; a matching email/domain alone
does not establish an association. Results always belong to the `from` entity.
Use `people.any(...)` for a company with at least one matching person
(`people.exists(...)` is equivalent). Inside the parentheses, fields refer to
that person. Do not invent SQL joins or forms such as `any people (...)`.

```text
-- One associated person must satisfy both conditions.
select from companies where people.any(email is_not_null and title contains "Engineer")

-- A simple conjunction of dotted person fields has the same meaning.
select from companies where people.email is_not_null and people.title contains "Engineer"

-- Separate any() clauses may match different people at the company.
select from companies where people.any(title = "CTO") and people.any(title = "CFO")

-- At least two associated people satisfy the inner predicate.
select from companies where people.count(email is_not_null) >= 2

-- People whose associated company has a domain.
select from people where email is_not_null and company.domain is_not_null
```

Prefer explicit `any(A and B)` when conditions must hold on the same related
record, especially with mixed `and`/`or` expressions. Separate `any(A)` and
`any(B)` clauses do not require different people, but allow them.
`people.title != "CTO"` means a related person has a nonmatching title;
it does **not** mean the company has no CTO.

Combine company fields and person conditions, then reuse the scope:

```bash
scope='from companies where domain is_not_null and people.any(email is_not_null and title contains "Engineer")'
clay audiences records search-count --query "count $scope"
clay audiences records search-ids --query "select $scope" --limit 10
```

Do not page through every result when the user asks only for the first 10.
Fetch field values with `records get` only if needed to answer or validate the
interpretation; count and ID commands do not return field values.

## Existence and relationship counts

Use `.exists(...)` (equivalent to `.any(...)`) for “at least one”, and `.count(...)`
when the number of matching related records matters. Put field conditions inside
the parentheses; put a numeric count comparison after them. Empty parentheses
mean all associated records, without a field condition.

| Question about a company                                        | Predicate                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Has any associated person                                       | `people.exists()`                                        |
| Has a person with both a title and an email                     | `people.exists(title is_not_null and email is_not_null)` |
| Has no person with an email, including companies with no people | `not people.exists(email is_not_null)`                   |
| Has at least three associated people                            | `people.count() >= 3`                                    |
| Has exactly two people with an email                            | `people.count(email is_not_null) = 2`                    |
| Has no people with an email                                     | `people.count(email is_not_null) = 0`                    |
| Has either zero or two people with an email                     | `people.count(email is_not_null) in (0, 2)`              |

Conditions inside one `.exists(...)` or `.count(...)` apply to the same related
record. Separate calls are independent: `people.exists(title = "CTO") and
people.exists(title = "CFO")` may match different people. Negation outside the
call means no matching people; `people.exists(title != "CTO")` only requires
one non-CTO and can still match a company that also has a CTO.

Count comparisons support `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `in`, and `not_in`
with numeric values. Positive upper bounds (`< N` / `<= N`), nonzero exclusions
(`!= N`), and `not_in` lists that omit zero only consider companies with at least
one matching person. Companies with zero matches never form a group. When zero
satisfies the requested condition, include it explicitly using the **same inner
predicate** in both count expressions:

| Requested matching-person count | Zero-inclusive predicate                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| At most three                   | `people.count(email is_not_null) = 0 or people.count(email is_not_null) <= 3`          |
| Anything except two             | `people.count(email is_not_null) = 0 or people.count(email is_not_null) != 2`          |
| Neither two nor three           | `people.count(email is_not_null) = 0 or people.count(email is_not_null) not_in (2, 3)` |

Wrap the entire `or` expression in parentheses before combining it with another
condition using `and`. Do not add the zero branch when the request excludes zero,
such as `people.count(...) != 0` or `people.count(...) not_in (0, 2)`.
The dedicated zero-match forms `= 0`, `< 1`, and `<= 0` already include companies
with no matches and need no extra branch.

```bash
clay audiences records search-ids --query 'select from companies where domain is_not_null and (people.count(email is_not_null) = 0 or people.count(email is_not_null) <= 3)' --limit 10
clay audiences records search-count --query 'count from companies where people.exists(email is_not_null) and people.count() >= 3'
```

The second command counts **companies** with at least three associated people
and at least one person with an email. `people.count(...)` filters companies by
the number of related people; it does not return that number or change the
result entity. Use `count from people ...` to count people themselves.
Nested relationship calls inside `.any(...)`, `.exists(...)`, or `.count(...)`
are unsupported.

Use `--audience-id` for saved audiences. If diagnosis reports an unsupported construct, retry with an equivalent `--filter`
AST on a supported people/company root using `filters.md` and `custom_objects.md`. Do not drop unsupported conditions.
The flags are mutually exclusive, and there is no automatic retry or translation.
Creating or updating saved audiences still uses the AST. Unfiltered deal counts
and ID searches use `--entity-type deals` without `--query`.
